# Content Provider

**Content provider for sharing notes with other apps**



**Features:**

- Android API 16

- SQLite



**Orientations:**

In Content Provider Class I used the UnsupportedSchemeException which is available from Android API 18 onwards. So I used the notation @RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR2) in the methods.
